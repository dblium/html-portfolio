<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>An enjoyable sci-fi action adventure.</p>
<h3>Perfect Blue</h3>
<p>Mind-bending and incredible editing choices. Perhaps the best pscyhological thriller ever.</p>
<h3>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</h3>
<p>Apichatpong may be one of the best directors today who truly understand the power of texture.</p>
<h3>Blue</h3>
<p>Moved me to tears.</p>
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>Uses every filmmaking technique in the book and throws constraint to the wind. Why not?</p>
